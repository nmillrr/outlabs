# Outlabs
**Outlabs** is an open-source project focused on clinical diagnostic accessibility. This repository provides transparent implementations of clinically relevant algorithms, with documentation for education, benchmarking, and low-resource research applications.

Clinical algorithms incredibly important to diagnostics and labs, but are often poorly documented and rarely accessible to the general public. Outlabs offers a transparent solution that teaches the equations and models behind the code, complete with cited literature. I hope this can be a tool for students, researchers, and maybe even clinicians in training.
