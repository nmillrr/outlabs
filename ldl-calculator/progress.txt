## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Project Structure and Dependencies
- What was implemented:
  - Created `ldlC/` package directory with `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `data.py`
  - Created `tests/` directory with `__init__.py` and `test_models.py`
  - Created `notebooks/` directory with `.gitkeep`
  - Created `requirements.txt` with all required dependencies
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/__init__.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/models.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/utils.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/data.py` (new)
  - `tests/__init__.py` (new)
  - `tests/test_models.py` (new)
  - `notebooks/.gitkeep` (new)
  - `requirements.txt` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - All modules have docstrings for future implementations
  - pytest import already in test_models.py for future tests
