# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Project Structure and Dependencies
- What was implemented:
  - Created `ldlC/` package directory with `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `data.py`
  - Created `tests/` directory with `__init__.py` and `test_models.py`
  - Created `notebooks/` directory with `.gitkeep`
  - Created `requirements.txt` with all required dependencies
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/__init__.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/models.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/utils.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/data.py` (new)
  - `tests/__init__.py` (new)
  - `tests/test_models.py` (new)
  - `notebooks/.gitkeep` (new)
  - `requirements.txt` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - All modules have docstrings for future implementations
  - pytest import already in test_models.py for future tests
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Implement Unit Conversion Utilities
- What was implemented:
  - Added `mg_dl_to_mmol_l(value, molecule='cholesterol')` function in `ldlC/utils.py`
  - Added `mmol_l_to_mg_dl(value, molecule='cholesterol')` function
  - Supports conversions for cholesterol (÷38.67) and triglycerides (÷88.57)
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_utils.py`
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/utils.py` (modified - added conversion functions)
  - `tests/test_utils.py` (new - 18 test cases)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Conversion factors: Cholesterol = 38.67, Triglycerides = 88.57
  - Molecule type is case-insensitive and supports aliases (tg, triglyceride, triglycerides)
  - Use `python -m pytest` instead of `pytest` on Windows if not in PATH
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Create NHANES Lipid Download Module
- What was implemented:
  - Added `download_nhanes_lipids(output_dir, cycles)` function in `ldlC/data.py`
  - Downloads TRIGLY, HDL, TCHOL XPT files for cycles 2005-2018
  - Downloads BIOPRO files (contains direct LDL measurements)
  - Creates `data/raw/` directory if not exists
  - Handles HTTP errors, URL errors gracefully with informative messages
  - Helper function `_download_file` for reusable download logic
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/data.py` (modified - added download functions)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - NHANES cycle suffixes: D=2005-06, E=2007-08, F=2009-10, G=2011-12, H=2013-14, I=2015-16, J=2017-18
  - Standard lipid files: TRIGLY, HDL, TCHOL (+ cycle suffix)
  - Direct LDL is in BIOPRO biochemistry profile files
  - PowerShell doesn't support `&&` for command chaining - use separate commands
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Implement XPT File Parser
- What was implemented:
  - Added `read_xpt(filepath)` function in `ldlC/data.py`
  - Uses pandas `read_sas()` with format='xport' to parse SAS transport files
  - Returns pandas DataFrame with all data from the XPT file
  - Raises FileNotFoundError with informative message if file doesn't exist
  - Raises ValueError with helpful message if file can't be parsed
  - Added pandas import to data.py
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_data.py`
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/data.py` (modified - added read_xpt function and pandas import)
  - `tests/test_data.py` (new - 4 test cases)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - pandas can read XPT files directly with `pd.read_sas(filepath, format='xport')`
  - pyreadstat module can be used to create test XPT files if needed
  - Test file for data module is separate from models tests
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Create NHANES Lipid Data Cleaning Pipeline
- What was implemented:
  - Added `clean_lipid_data(tc_df, hdl_df, tg_df, ldl_direct_df)` function in `ldlC/data.py`
  - Function merges TC, HDL, TG, and direct LDL DataFrames on SEQN (sample ID)
  - Renames columns to standardized names: tc_mgdl, hdl_mgdl, tg_mgdl, ldl_direct_mgdl
  - Removes physiologic outliers: TC < 50, TG > 2000, HDL < 10 mg/dL
  - Calculates non_hdl_mgdl (TC - HDL)
  - Supports custom column names via optional parameters
  - Drops rows with missing values before cleaning
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/data.py` (modified - added clean_lipid_data function)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - NHANES column names: LBXTC (TC), LBDHDD (HDL), LBXSTR (TG), LBDLDL (direct LDL)
  - Inner join ensures only complete records with all lipid measurements are kept
  - Outlier thresholds based on physiologically implausible values
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Generate Data Quality Report
- What was implemented:
  - Added `generate_quality_report(df, output_path)` function in `ldlC/data.py`
  - Report includes: record count, mean/SD/min/max for TC/HDL/TG/LDL-direct
  - Includes missing value counts for each lipid column
  - Includes TG distribution breakdown (<150, 150-400, 400-800, >800 mg/dL) with percentages
  - Saves formatted report to specified path as text file
  - Returns dict with all metrics for programmatic access
  - Creates parent directories if they don't exist
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/data.py` (modified - added generate_quality_report function)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - TG distribution thresholds based on clinical guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia
  - Function returns both a text file and dict for flexibility
  - All 22 existing tests continue to pass
