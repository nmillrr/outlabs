# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Project Structure and Dependencies
- What was implemented:
  - Created `ldlC/` package directory with `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `data.py`
  - Created `tests/` directory with `__init__.py` and `test_models.py`
  - Created `notebooks/` directory with `.gitkeep`
  - Created `requirements.txt` with all required dependencies
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/__init__.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/models.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/utils.py` (new)
  - `ldlC/data.py` (new)
  - `tests/__init__.py` (new)
  - `tests/test_models.py` (new)
  - `notebooks/.gitkeep` (new)
  - `requirements.txt` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - All modules have docstrings for future implementations
  - pytest import already in test_models.py for future tests
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Implement Unit Conversion Utilities
- What was implemented:
  - Added `mg_dl_to_mmol_l(value, molecule='cholesterol')` function in `ldlC/utils.py`
  - Added `mmol_l_to_mg_dl(value, molecule='cholesterol')` function
  - Supports conversions for cholesterol (÷38.67) and triglycerides (÷88.57)
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_utils.py`
- Files changed:
  - `ldlC/utils.py` (modified - added conversion functions)
  - `tests/test_utils.py` (new - 18 test cases)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Conversion factors: Cholesterol = 38.67, Triglycerides = 88.57
  - Molecule type is case-insensitive and supports aliases (tg, triglyceride, triglycerides)
  - Use `python -m pytest` instead of `pytest` on Windows if not in PATH
